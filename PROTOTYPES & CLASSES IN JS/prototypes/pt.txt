Yes, you should have a basic understanding of **prototypes** in JavaScript, even when using ES6 and beyond. Hereâ€™s why:

### 1. **Prototypes Are the Foundation of JavaScript Objects**
   - JavaScript is **prototype-based**, meaning that every object in JavaScript inherits from another object called its **prototype**.
   - Even with ES6 **classes**, JavaScript still uses prototypes under the hood.

### 2. **Understanding How Methods Are Shared**
   - Prototypes allow objects to share methods efficiently, instead of creating new copies for each object.
   - Example:
     ```js
     function Person(name) {
         this.name = name;
     }

     Person.prototype.sayHello = function() {
         console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
     };

     const person1 = new Person("Alice");
     person1.sayHello(); // Hello, my name is Alice
     ```

### 3. **ES6 Classes Still Use Prototypes**
   - When you define a class in ES6, it's syntactic sugar over prototypes.
   - Example:
     ```js
     class Person {
         constructor(name) {
             this.name = name;
         }

         sayHello() {
             console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
         }
     }

     const person1 = new Person("Alice");
     person1.sayHello(); // Hello, my name is Alice
     ```
   - Here, `sayHello()` is actually stored on `Person.prototype`, just like in the ES5 version.

### 4. **Why You Should Know Prototypes**
   - Helps in **memory optimization** (methods are not duplicated per object).
   - Required for **inheritance** in JavaScript (before ES6 `class` syntax).
   - Useful for **modifying built-in objects** (though not recommended).
     ```js
     Array.prototype.sum = function() {
         return this.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
     };

     console.log([1, 2, 3].sum()); // 6
     ```
   - Debugging **prototype chain issues** is easier when you understand how prototypes work.

### 5. **Prototype Chain & `__proto__`**
   - Every object has a hidden `__proto__` property pointing to its prototype.
   - Example:
     ```js
     console.log(person1.__proto__ === Person.prototype); // true
     ```
   - The prototype chain is how JavaScript looks up properties when they're not found directly on an object.

---

### **Conclusion**
Even if you're using ES6+ features like `class`, you should still understand prototypes because:
1. JavaScript is still **prototype-based**.
2. **ES6 classes** use prototypes internally.
3. Helps in debugging and optimizing JavaScript applications.

### **🔹 Closures in JavaScript**
A **closure** is a function that **remembers** the variables from its **outer scope** even after the outer function has finished executing.  

👉 **Definition:**  
> A closure is created when a function **accesses variables from its lexical scope**, even after the outer function has returned.

## **🔹 How Closures Work?**
### ✅ **Example 1: Basic Closure**
```javascript
function outerFunction() {
    let count = 0; // Local variable

    return function innerFunction() {  
        count++;  // Inner function accesses `count` from outer scope
        console.log(count);
    };
}

const counter = outerFunction(); // `counter` holds `innerFunction`
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
counter(); // 3
```
### 🔍 **What Happens Here?**
1️⃣ `outerFunction()` runs and **returns `innerFunction`**.  
2️⃣ The returned `innerFunction()` **remembers `count`**, even though `outerFunction` has already executed.  
3️⃣ Each time `counter()` is called, it **increments `count`** because the variable is preserved inside the closure.

## **🔹 Why Use Closures?**
✔ **Encapsulation** – Variables inside closures **cannot be accessed directly** from outside.  
✔ **Data Privacy** – Used to create **private variables** in JavaScript.  
✔ **Memoization** – Used in **caching and optimization techniques**.  
✔ **Event Listeners & Callbacks** – Useful in **async programming**.

## **🔹 Real-World Example: Click Event Handler**
```javascript
function buttonClickHandler() {
    let clickCount = 0;

    return function () {
        clickCount++;
        console.log(`Button clicked ${clickCount} times`);
    };
}

const handleClick = buttonClickHandler(); // Create closure
document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", handleClick);
```
✅ Each time the button is clicked, the closure **remembers** `clickCount` and increments it.

## **🔹 Common Interview Question**
🔹 **Q:** How would you create a private variable using a closure?  
🔹 **A:** Use a closure to **hide data** inside a function:
```javascript
function createBankAccount(initialBalance) {
    let balance = initialBalance; // Private variable

    return {
        deposit: function (amount) {
            balance += amount;
            console.log(`New Balance: ${balance}`);
        },
        withdraw: function (amount) {
            if (amount <= balance) {
                balance -= amount;
                console.log(`New Balance: ${balance}`);
            } else {
                console.log("Insufficient funds!");
            }
        },
        getBalance: function () {
            return balance;
        }
    };
}

const myAccount = createBankAccount(1000);
myAccount.deposit(500); // New Balance: 1500
myAccount.withdraw(2000); // Insufficient funds!
console.log(myAccount.balance); // ❌ Undefined (Private variable)
```
✅ The `balance` variable **cannot be accessed directly**, making it **private**.

### **🔹 Key Takeaways**
1️⃣ **Closures allow functions to "remember" variables from their outer scope.**  
2️⃣ **They are useful for data privacy, encapsulation, and maintaining state.**  
3️⃣ **Closures are widely used in event handling, setTimeout, and functional programming.**
